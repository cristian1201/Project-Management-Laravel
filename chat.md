Hi.
I think it's better to clarify our agreement about the project.
I want step-by-step job.
And the following is my opinion and pls check and discuss.

1. budget and deadline
	300USD, not agent(until december or january)
2. Milestone
	- STEP 1: login and register page: in one day.
		At this point, I require an upfront.(50USD)
	- STEP 2: implement user and team management.(100USD)
		In the other word, make user manage page, team manage page.
	- STEP 3: implement task management.(100USD)
		Here, all the functional things are available.
	- STEP 4: complete the project and feedback here.(50USD)

After agreement, I will start work immediately.
